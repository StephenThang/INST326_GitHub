# Step 1: Data Gathering
# Read the hospital admission dataset from a file (e.g., CSV)
data = pd.read_csv("hospital_admission_data.csv")

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Handle missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")
data = imputer.fit_transform(data)

# Handle outliers
# Perform data cleaning, feature scaling, etc.

# Step 3: Feature Selection and Engineering
# Identify and engineer the most informative features
# Domain-specific feature selection and engineering code

# Step 4: Machine Learning Models
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = data.drop("admission_status", axis=1)
y = data["admission_status"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Choose and train predictive models
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Model Training

# Step 6: Performance Evaluation
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

# Step 7: User Interface
# Create a Flask web application for the user interface
app = Flask(__name)

    # Receive patient information from the user
    patient_data = request.json
